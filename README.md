### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Shivam here

I make high quality apps which are beautiful, fast, accessible and scalable.

*I don't use cutting edge technologies, I use bleeding edge.* (I hope you don't mind)

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- React
- React Native
- GraphQL
- DynamoDB
- NodeJS
- Lambdas
- AWS CDK
- Amazon Cognito
- This will never end...

You give me problems, I give you solution. Deal?

### This is what I am currently listening to ðŸ¤˜
